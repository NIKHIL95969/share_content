## ## ðŸŽ¯ About The Project

Ever found yourself working on one computer and needing to send a quick link or code block to your phone or another device? The usual solution involves emailing yourself or logging into a messaging app. QuickShare simplifies this into a two-step process: paste your content to get a unique code, and use that code to retrieve it on any other device instantly.

### ## âœ¨ Features

* **Instant Anonymous Sharing:** Quickly share text or code and receive a short, human-readable code (e.g., `BLUE-CAT-9`).
* **User Accounts:** Sign up to save your shared content to a personal profile and access your history from anywhere.
* **File Sharing:** Easily upload and share files like images, videos, and documents.
* **Private & Secure:** Authenticated users can generate private, unguessable links for their content and add an extra layer of password protection.
* **Code Highlighting:** Pasted code snippets are automatically formatted and highlighted for readability.

# üöÄ QuickShare - Seamless Content Sharing

QuickShare is a web platform designed to solve the simple problem of sharing text, code snippets, and files between your devices without the hassle of logging into messaging apps.

## üéØ About The Project

Ever found yourself working on one computer and needing to send a quick link or code block to your phone or another device? The usual solution involves emailing yourself or logging into a messaging app. QuickShare simplifies this into a two-step process: paste your content to get a unique code, and use that code to retrieve it on any other device instantly.

## üõ† Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

---

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quickshare.git
cd quickshare

```

## Withou Docker

- Create .env file and add these variables
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URL=your_mongo_connection_string
REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string
TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key
```

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install


npm run dev
```

## With Docker
### Development Mode
- Setup docker locally
- add .env variables in docker-compose.dev.yml file
```bash
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: development
      MONGO_URL: mongo_url
      REDIS_URL: redis_url
      TOKEN_SECRET: local-secret
```
- Build and start the app with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

üëâ App will be available at http://localhost:8080

----
### Production Mode
- Build the production-ready image:

```bash
docker build -t quickshare:prod --target runner .
```

- Run the container with environment variables:
```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 \
  -e MONGO_URL=your_mongo_connection_string \
  -e REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string \
  -e TOKEN_SECRET=your_secret_key \
  quickshare:prod
```

üëâ App will be available at http://localhost:8080

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deploy to Google Cloud Run (CI/CD with Cloud Build)

You can deploy this project to Google Cloud Run with automated builds from GitHub using Cloud Build.

### 1. Setup GCP Project
```bash
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```


Enable required APIs:

```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    secretmanager.googleapis.com
```
### 2. Store Secrets in Secret Manager
```bash
echo "your-mongo-url" | gcloud secrets create MONGO_URL --data-file=-
echo "your-redis-url" | gcloud secrets create REDIS_URL --data-file=-
echo "your-token-secret" | gcloud secrets create TOKEN_SECRET --data-file=-
echo "your-domain" | gcloud secrets create DOMAIN --data-file=-
```

### 3. Connect GitHub Repo to Cloud Build
- Go to Cloud Build ‚Üí Triggers in the GCP Console.
- Create a new trigger linked to your GitHub repo.
- Select cloudbuild.yaml as the build config file.

Now, whenever you push to the selected branch (e.g., main), Cloud Build will:

- ‚úÖ Build your Docker image
- ‚úÖ Push it to Google Container Registry 
- ‚úÖ Deploy it to Cloud Run with secrets injected

--------------
### üëâ With this setup, you can
- Run locally with Next.js
- Run in Docker (dev/prod)
- Deploy automatically to Cloud Run with CI/CD
